I do work related to Ianus Simulation as [@s4b7r-ianus](https://github.com/s4b7r-ianus).

## Materials Science Workflows

- Classical Spin Dynamics Workflow: can also be found in the [MaterialDigital Workflow Store](https://workflows.material-digital.de/workflow/76)
  - The top-level pyiron workflow: [cinola-pyiron-workflow](https://github.com/s4b7r/cinola-pyiron-workflow)
  - The pyiron job implementation used in the workflow: [cinola-pyiron-job](https://github.com/s4b7r/cinola-pyiron-job)
  - The binary distribution of the spin dynamics code: [CINOLA-binary-distribution](https://github.com/s4b7r/CINOLA-binary-distribution)
